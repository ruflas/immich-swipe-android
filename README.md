# Immich Swipe

[Version française ici](README.fr.md)

Immich Swipe is an open-source Android application designed to make sorting your photos and videos hosted on your [Immich](https://immich.app/) server easy and fun.

Inspired by the [Sponge](https://get-sponge.com/) app (similar concept for local files), it allows you to quickly sort your media using simple swipe gestures, featuring a smooth and modern interface.

## ✨ Features

- **🚀 Fast Sorting Stack**: Swipe right to keep, left to delete. The scrolling banner at the top gives you direct visual feedback on your choices and upcoming media.
- **🕒 Snooze (SKIP)**: Unsure about a photo? Skip it. It will automatically reappear in your stack after a delay you configure (e.g., 1 day, 1 month, or never).
- **🛡️ Deferred Sync**: Immich Swipe doesn't delete anything without your final approval. Your choices are stored locally, and you trigger the actual deletion on the Immich server when you're ready via **Review Mode**.
- **💾 Session Save**: Leave the app and come back later: your progress in each album is saved.
- **📂 Multi-Album Management**: The app perfectly handles media present in multiple albums simultaneously.
- **🚦 Connection Diagnostic**: A visual indicator (Green/Orange/Red) informs you in real-time of the connection status to your server.
- **🎨 Modern Interface**: Developed with Jetpack Compose and Material Design 3, supporting both Light and Dark themes.

## ⚙️ Configuration

1. Enter your Immich server URL (e.g., `https://immich.your-domain.com`).
